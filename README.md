A simple Node.js application to check the availability of GitHub usernames. This tool helps you quickly determine whether a username is available for registration on GitHub.

## Features

- Checks the availability of multiple usernames from a text file.
- Outputs available usernames to a separate file.
- Provides a clear console output indicating the availability of each username.

## Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (version 12 or higher)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (Node package manager)

## Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/infallibless/github-username-checker.git
   cd github-username-checker
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install axios kleur
   ```

3. Create a file named `usernames.txt` in the project directory. Add the usernames you want to check, each on a new line.

## Usage

```bash
node index.js

The script will read usernames from `usernames.txt`, check their availability, and log the results in the console. Available usernames will be saved in `available.txt`.
